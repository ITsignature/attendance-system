  1. Remove the footer (lines 36-57 in DashboardView.tsx)

  Remove the "Design and Developed by adminmart.com" footer entirely.

  2. Fetch real data from backend

  Create API calls to get:
  - Total employee count
  - Today's attendance count
  - Employees on leave today
  - Weekly attendance trends
  - Recent attendance records

  3. Fix the stat cards with proper data

  - TotalEmployees: Show actual employee count from database
  - TodayAttendance: Show count of employees who checked in today
  - OnLeaveToday: Show count of employees on leave today

  4. Use appropriate icons

  - Total Employees: solar:users-group-rounded-bold or solar:user-circle-bold
  - Today Attendance: solar:calendar-check-bold or solar:check-circle-bold
  - On Leave: solar:calendar-remove-bold or solar:close-circle-bold

  5. Rename ProductRevenue component

  It should be called RecentAttendance or AttendanceTable since it's showing employee attendance, not product revenue.

  6. Connect real attendance data

  Replace the mock employee data with real data from your backend API.

  Would you like me to implement these changes? I can:

  Option A: Remove the footer and fix icons/naming (quick cleanup)
  Option B: Implement full backend integration with API calls to fetch real data
  Option C: Both A and B - complete overhaul with dynamic data
